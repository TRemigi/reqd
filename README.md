# REQD ‚Äî Request Dispatcher

**reqd** is a fast, flexible HTTP request dispatcher written in Go. It reads JSON request data from a file and sends requests concurrently to a target URL using any HTTP method, making it useful for testing APIs or replaying large datasets of requests to test API versions.

## Features

- ‚ö° High-concurrency with configurable worker pool  
- üß† Smart configuration: prioritizes CLI flags, then config file, then interactive prompts  
- üìÅ Reads request data from a JSON file  
- üîê Supports custom token schemes (e.g. Bearer)  
- üìä Progress bar display for visibility into request processing  
- üßº Graceful shutdown with context cancellation  

## Installation

```sh
go install github.com/TRemigi/reqd@latest
```

Make sure `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is in your `PATH`.

## Usage

```sh
reqd -d ./data.json -m POST -s Bearer -t YOUR_TOKEN -u https://example.com/api -w 10
```

You can also define defaults in a config file at `~/.reqd.conf`:

```ini
data_file = ./data.json
method = POST
token_scheme = Bearer
token_value = YOUR_TOKEN
url = https://example.com/api
worker_count = 10
```

If any required values are missing from CLI flags and the config file, `reqd` will prompt you interactively.

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-d` | Path to JSON file containing an array of request data objects |
| `-m` | HTTP method to use (`POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.) |
| `-s` | Auth token scheme (e.g. `Bearer`) |
| `-t` | Auth token value |
| `-u` | Target URL |
| `-w` | Number of concurrent worker goroutines to dispatch requests |
| `-h` | Show help message and exit |

## Input Format

The data file should be a JSON array of objects. Each object represents one request's parameters:

```json
[
  {"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"},
  {"name": "Bob", "email": "bob@example.com"}
]
```

These are sent as request bodies for `POST`, query parameters for `GET`, etc., depending on the method.

## Configuration Precedence

Values are resolved in the following order:

1. Command-line flags  
2. `~/.reqd.conf` config file  
3. Interactive prompt  

## Reporting

REQD logs all requests that result in unsuccessful HTTP responses (i.e., non-2xx status codes) to a report file.
This includes both the request body and the corresponding response body for each failed request.

The report file is created in the current working directory with a timestamped filename:
```
./<timestamp>.rpt
```
Where `<timestamp>` is the current date and time truncated to seconds, in the format:
```
YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.rpt
```

This allows you to inspect and analyze failed requests after a run for debugging or auditing purposes.
